# Image Classifier using VGG16 CNN architecture 

- Image Classifier using Pytorch with **VGG16** architecture to classify 102 types of images and dynamic options of training by specifying parameters using training and prediction Python scripts

## Files and data description
The project is organized with the following directory architecture:

- Image Classifier Project.ipynb        --> contains building a PyTorch model to create the classifier
- train.py        --> contains a script to train a PyTorch model with command line parameters like choosing the number of hidden units, number of epochs, and using GPU or CPU for trainning
- predictions.py          --> contains a script to make predictions using a model checkpoint
